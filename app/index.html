<h1>What is Zoroaster?</h1>
<p>
    <span class="tm">zoroaster</span> is a testing framework for Node.js.
    Unlike <span class="tm">mocha</span> and <span class="tm">jasmine</span>,
    it does not export global functions like describe, it, before, beforeAll, breforeEach, but requires to add
    test functions as properties of an object. This object can be exported
    with module.exports in test.js file, and then `zoroaster test`
    command can be used to start testing.

<h2> Why use Zoroaster? </h2>
You should use zoroaster if you've had enough of mocha's before and stuff and wanna do something different,
and since tests should be completely independent (with a controlled context), it helps to think of every test
function as a unit, a method, which should not produce any side effects, i.e. be as pure as possible.

When working with zoroaster, you write tests like this:

this is an example of code
